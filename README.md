## Predicting Ofsted School Grading with Machine Learning Models
- Welcome to our repository for predicting Ofsted school grading using machine learning models! 
- This project aims to provide insights into school performance based on various features and criteria. 
- We have developed and evaluated eight different machine learning models to predict Ofsted school grading. 
- Below, you'll find an overview of each model and links to detailed documentation for each one.

Overview
- In the UK, Ofsted (Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills) evaluates schools based on various criteria to ensure high-quality education. 
- Our project leverages advanced machine learning models to predict Ofsted school grading.
- These models have been developed using state-of-the-art techniques and evaluated rigorously to ensure their reliability and accuracy.


Model Cards and Datasheet
- Before exploring the models, we encourage you to review the Model Cards and Datasheet for more detailed information on each model and the dataset used.

- Model Cards: Provides detailed information about each model, including its architecture, training data, evaluation metrics, and ethical considerations.

- Datasheet: Offers insights into the dataset used for training the models, including its source, size, features, preprocessing steps, and performance metrics.

- Models Included
Our repository includes the following machine learning models:

GaussianNB
