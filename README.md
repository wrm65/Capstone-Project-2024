## Predicting Ofsted School Grading with Machine Learning Models
- Welcome to our repository for predicting Ofsted school grading using machine learning models! 
- This project aims to provide insights into school performance based on various features and criteria. 
- We have developed and evaluated eight different machine learning models to predict Ofsted school grading. 
- Below, you'll find an overview of each model and links to detailed documentation for each one.

### Overview
- In the UK, Ofsted (Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills) evaluates schools based on various criteria to ensure high-quality education. 
- Our project leverages advanced machine learning models to predict Ofsted school grading.
- These models have been developed using state-of-the-art techniques and evaluated rigorously to ensure their reliability and accuracy.


### Model Cards and Datasheet
- Before exploring the models, we encourage you to review the Model Cards and Datasheet for more detailed information on each model and the dataset used.

- **Models Included** Our repository includes the following machine learning models:

   <p>
    <ol type="1">
    <li>Decision Tree Classifier</li>
    <li>Gradient Boosting Classifier</li>
    <li>K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier</li>
    <li>Logistic Regression</li>
    <li>Multilayer Perceptron Classifier</li>
    <li>Naive Bayes</li>
    <li>Random Forest Classifier</li>
    <li>Support Vector Classifier</li>
    </ol>
   </p>

### Ethical Considerations
- It's crucial to consider ethical implications when using machine learning models for educational assessment. These models may inadvertently perpetuate biases present in the training data, leading to unfair outcomes for certain groups of students. Additionally, decisions made based on model predictions may impact students' educational opportunities and trajectories.

### Conclusion
- Based on our evaluation, the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) emerged as the best model for predicting Ofsted school grading. It achieved the highest accuracy and performed well across various performance metrics. However, it's essential to consider other factors such as interpretability, computational complexity, and ethical considerations when selecting the best model for deployment in real-world scenarios.
