# Dataset Name: Ofsted Inspected School Dataset

## Motivation

- <b>For what purpose was the dataset created?</b> Ofsted Inspected School Dataset was created to provide data which could be used predict the likely grade that a school would receive in its next inspection.
- <b>Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?</b> The dataset is created from the UK Government website [Get Information about Schools](https://www.get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/). As the data is updated daily and can be filtered from the Department of Education's School Register, an "on-demand" service is provided and the dataset is created as and when required.
- <b>Who funded the creation of the dataset?</b> Creation of the dataset is freely available. 

 
## Composition

- <b>What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)?<b> 
- How many instances of each type are there? 
- Is there any missing data?
- Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by    doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?

## Collection process

- How was the data acquired? The dataset is created from the online register provided by the Department of Education
- If the data is a sample of a larger subset, what was the sampling strategy? 
- Over what time frame was the data collected?

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section. 
- Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)? 
 
## Uses

- What other tasks could the dataset be used for? 
- Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms? 
- Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.

## Distribution

- How has the dataset already been distributed? 
- Is it subject to any copyright or other intellectual property (IP) license, and/or under applicable terms of use (ToU)?
