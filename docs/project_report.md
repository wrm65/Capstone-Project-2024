## Project Report

- This project is a culmination of the completion of the six months programme on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 
- In Module 2: Introduction to Machine Learning, we learned about the ten steps of a typical machine learning project and, in completing this final project, these are the steps that were applied:
   <p>
    <ol type="1">
     <li><b>Define the purpose of the ML project</b>
     <ul>
       <li>Understanding the objective: Predicting Ofsted school grading based on various features.</li>
       <li>Identifying the target variable and potential predictors.</li>
       <li>Defining success criteria for model evaluation.</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
     <li><b>Obtain the data set for the analysis</b>
     <ul>
       <li>Gathering relevant data sources related to schools and Ofsted ratings.</li>
       <li>Ensuring data quality and completeness.</li>
       <li>Handling missing values appropriately.</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
     <li><b>Explore, clean & preprocess the data</b>
     <ul>
       <li>Exploring and visualising the data to gain insights into distributions.</li>
       <li>Preprocessing data, including encoding categorical variables, and handling imbalanced classes.</li>
       <li>The over-sampling technique SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) was used to address the imbalanced classes.</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
     <li><b>Dimension reduction & feature engineering</b>
     <ul>
       <li>Selecting relevant features that could impact Ofsted ratings.</li>
       <li>Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
     <li><b>Determine the ML task at hand</b>
     <ul>
       <li>Evaluating different algorithms suitable for the prediction task, such as regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods.</li>
       <li>I included two additional models which we did not cover during the programme - Gradient Boosting Classifier and Multilayer Perceptron Classifier.</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
     <li><b>Partition the data (if supervised ML)</b>
     <ul>
       <li>Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
     <li><b>Choose the ML technique(s)</b>
     <ul>
       <li>Training selected models using the training data.</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
     <li><b>Use the ML technique(s)</b>
     <ul>
       <li>Tuning hyperparameters to optimise model performance.</li>
       <li>Considering the trade-offs between model complexity, interpretability, and performance.</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
     <li><b>Interpret the results</b>
     <ul>
       <li>Assessing model performance using evaluation metrics relevant to the problem, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.</li>
       <li>Comparing models based on their performance on the testing set.</li>
       <li>Understanding the factors driving predictions through model interpretation techniques such as feature importance analysis or decision tree.</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
     <li><b>Deploy the ML technique (optional)</b>
     <ul>
       <li>not required</li>
     </ul>
     </li>
    </ol>
