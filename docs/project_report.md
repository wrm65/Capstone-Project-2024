## Project Report

- This project is a culmination of the completion of the six months programme on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 
- In Module 2: Introduction to Machine Learning, we learned about the ten steps of a typical machine learning project and, in completing this final project these sre the steps that were applied:

    <ol type="1">
     <li><b>Project Definition:</b>

       - Understanding the objective: Predicting Ofsted school grading based on various features.
       - Identifying the target variable and potential predictors.
       - Defining success criteria for model evaluation.

     </li>
     <li><b>Data Collection:</b>
     
       - Gathering relevant data sources related to schools and Ofsted ratings.
       - Ensuring data quality and completeness.
       - Handling missing values appropriately.

     </li>
     <li><b>Data Preparation:</b>

       - Exploring and visualising the data to gain insights into distributions.
       - Preprocessing data, including encoding categorical variables, and handling imbalanced classes.
       - Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.

     </li>
     <li><b>Feature Engineering:</b>

       - Selecting relevant features that could impact Ofsted ratings.
       - Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.

     </li>
     <li><b>Model Selection:</b>

       - Evaluating different algorithms suitable for the prediction task, such as regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods.
       - Considering the trade-offs between model complexity, interpretability, and performance.

     </li>
     <li><b>Model Training:</b>

       - Training selected models using the training data.
       - Tuning hyperparameters to optimise model performance.

     </li>
     <li><b>Model Evaluation:</b>

       - Assessing model performance using evaluation metrics relevant to the problem, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.
       - Comparing models based on their performance on the validation set.

     </li>
     <li><b>Model Interpretation:</b>

       - Understanding the factors driving predictions through model interpretation techniques such as feature importance analysis or decision tree.

     </li>
