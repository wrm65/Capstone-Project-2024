## Project Report

- This project is a culmination of the completion of the six months programme on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 
- In Module 2: Introduction to Machine Learning, we learned about the ten steps of a typical machine learning project and, in completing this final project these sre the steps that were applied:
   <p>
    <ol type="1">
     <li><b>Project Definition:</b>

       <li>Understanding the objective: Predicting Ofsted school grading based on various features.</li>
       <li>Identifying the target variable and potential predictors.</li>
       <li>Defining success criteria for model evaluation.</li>

     </li>
     <li><b>Data Collection:</b>
     
       <li>Gathering relevant data sources related to schools and Ofsted ratings.</li>
       <li>Ensuring data quality and completeness.</li>
       <li>Handling missing values appropriately.</li>

     </li>
     <li><b>Data Preparation:</b>

       <li>Exploring and visualising the data to gain insights into distributions.</li>
       <li>reprocessing data, including encoding categorical variables, and handling imbalanced classes.</li>
       <li>Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.</li>

     </li>
     <li><b>Feature Engineering:</b>

       <li>Selecting relevant features that could impact Ofsted ratings.</li>
       <li>Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.</li>

     </li>
     <li><b>Model Selection:</b>

       <li>Evaluating different algorithms suitable for the prediction task, such as regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods.</li>
       <li>Considering the trade-offs between model complexity, interpretability, and performance.</li>

     </li>
     <li><b>Model Training:</b>

       <li>Training selected models using the training data.</li>
       <li>Tuning hyperparameters to optimise model performance.</li>

     </li>
     <li><b>Model Evaluation:</b>

       <li>Assessing model performance using evaluation metrics relevant to the problem, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.</li>
       <li>Comparing models based on their performance on the validation set.</li>

     </li>
     <li><b>Model Interpretation:</b>

       <li>Understanding the factors driving predictions through model interpretation techniques such as feature importance analysis or decision tree.</li>

     </li>
