This is especially important in educational settings where stakeholders such as teachers, administrators, and policymakers need to comprehend the factors driving school grading decisions.\n",
    "> - **Feature Importance**: Decision trees provide insight into the relative importance of different features in predicting school grading. By examining the decision rules and splits in the tree, stakeholders can identify which features have the greatest influence on the classification outcome. This information can inform targeted interventions and improvement strategies.\n",

This natural representation can facilitate discussions and collaboration between educators, policymakers, and other stakeholders involved in education quality and improvement efforts.\n",
